Introduction
Aim and Description

The Hotel Reservation System is a comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project designed to manage hotel bookings, customer details, and financial transactions. The aim of this project is to create a flexible and scalable system that facilitates hotel management tasks, including booking rooms, handling customer information, generating bills, and maintaining financial records.
Project Highlights

    Modular Design: The project is structured with modular components, each responsible for specific functionalities.
    Object-Oriented Approach: Utilizes the principles of OOP for improved code organization, reusability, and maintainability.
    Integration with External Libraries: Uses external libraries such as jinja2 for templating and pdfkit for PDF generation.
    Dynamic Room Management: Tracks room availability, status, and pricing dynamically.

Applications

The Hotel Reservation System is designed for use in the hospitality industry, providing hotel owners and staff with a tool to efficiently manage bookings, track customer information, and generate bills. This system can be customized and extended to accommodate the specific needs of various hotels and resorts.
Project Structure
Classes

    Hotel Class:
        Represents a hotel with attributes such as name and location.
        Provides methods to retrieve hotel details.

    Rooms Class:
        Represents different types of rooms within a hotel.
        Tracks the availability, status, and pricing of each room.
        Allows dynamic adjustment of room prices.

    System Class:
        Manages the overall system, including the wallet and booking functionalities.
        Facilitates room booking, cancellation, check-in, check-out, and final payment processing.

    Customer Class:
        Captures customer details, including name, phone number, email, and booking information.
        Generates a unique customer ID for identification.
        Handles customer-related actions such as check-in, check-out, and booking cancellation.

    Calendar Class:
        Provides methods to obtain the current date and time.
        Used for timestamping customer actions.

    Bill Class:
        Manages the billing system, including the generation of bills in PDF format.
        Tracks a unique bill number for each transaction.

    Wallet Class:
        Represents a customer's wallet and handles financial transactions.
        Allows funds to be added to or deducted from the wallet.

Wallet System

    The Wallet system handles financial transactions within the hotel reservation system.
    It tracks the balance of a customer's wallet and provides methods for adding or deducting funds.

Booking System

    The Booking system is responsible for managing room bookings, cancellations, and check-in/check-out processes.
    It interacts with the Wallet system to handle financial transactions related to bookings.

Bill Generation

    The Bill generation system creates a detailed bill in PDF format for each customer.
    It uses the jinja2 library for templating and pdfkit for PDF generation.

Customer Management

    The Customer management system captures and manages customer details.
    It generates a unique customer ID and handles various customer-related actions.

Calendar

    The Calendar class provides methods to obtain the current date and time.
    It is used for timestamping customer actions.

Limitations and Drawbacks

    Dependency on External Libraries:
        The system relies on external libraries such as jinja2 and pdfkit. Ensure these libraries are installed and compatible.

    Simplified Pricing Model:
        The pricing model for rooms is straightforward, and more complex pricing strategies (e.g., seasonal pricing) are not implemented.

    Limited Error Handling:
        The system lacks comprehensive error handling, and unexpected inputs may lead to undesired behavior.

    Single Hotel Support:
        The current implementation supports a single hotel. Extending it to manage multiple hotels would require additional modifications.

    Security Concerns:
        The system does not address security aspects, such as data encryption or protection against unauthorized access.

    User Interface:
        This project primarily focuses on the backend logic, and no graphical user interface (GUI) is provided.

Conclusion

The Hotel Reservation System is a versatile OOP project that demonstrates the core principles of object-oriented design. It can be utilized as a foundation for developing more advanced hotel management systems. To enhance the project, consider incorporating additional features, improving error handling, and addressing security concerns. This documentation serves as a guide for understanding the project structure, functionalities, and potential areas for improvement.
